# Analyzing-Economic-Growth-and-Regional-Disparities
This project analyzes global GDP data from the World Bank database, covering the period from 1991 to 2023, to understand the scale of economic disparities and growth trends across regions. It examines how economies have developed over time, highlighting differences in growth rates to measure the extent of these disparities.
